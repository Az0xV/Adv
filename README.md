Short, logical game. At max it's 30 minutes gameplay.
This is one of my first games, I like how it looks and I enjoyed time finding, what is happening with my lightning system.

## Controls
crouch - control

left mouse button/e - interact

g - drop item

You are faster when crouching in air.

Consistent jumping is making you go faster.

You can hold space to jump constantly.
